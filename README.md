# Retail-Space-Planning
1. In this project, we built a forecasting model that would help clients forecast for short term horizons (6 months) in the retail industry, specifically supermarkets, to help them plan the retail space required to accommodate the predicted sales volume for their new supermarket project in the US.
2. Along with a short term forecasting model, we advise the client about what process they should follow to address their long-term planning problem, and what information should they collect to inform this process.
3. We presented a summary report to inform their short-term planning with departmental volume forecasts that take seasonal patterns at other stores.
4. We highlighted revising their space allocation in anticipation of seasonal peaks of demand in the final report.
